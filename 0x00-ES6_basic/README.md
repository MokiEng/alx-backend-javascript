ES6 stands for ECMAScript 2015, and it's a significant update to the JavaScript language. ECMAScript is the standard upon which JavaScript is based, and ES6 introduced many new features and enhancements to the language. Some of the key features of ES6 include:

1. **Arrow Functions**: Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax for defining functions, especially for short, one-line functions.

   ```javascript
   // ES5 function
   function add(a, b) {
       return a + b;
   }

   // ES6 arrow function
   const add = (a, b) => a + b;
   ```

2. **Let and Const**: `let` and `const` provide block-scoped variables, replacing `var`. `const` is used for constants that cannot be reassigned.

   ```javascript
   let x = 5;
   const PI = 3.14159;
   ```

3. **Template Literals**: Template literals allow for easier string interpolation, making it simpler to embed expressions within strings.

   ```javascript
   const name = 'Alice';
   console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
   ```

4. **Classes**: ES6 introduced a more familiar class syntax for defining classes, making it easier to work with object-oriented programming in JavaScript.

   ```javascript
   class Person {
       constructor(name) {
           this.name = name;
       }
       sayHello() {
           console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Modules**: ES6 introduced a standardized module system, allowing you to create reusable code in separate files and import/export functionality.

   ```javascript
   // In math.js
   export const add = (a, b) => a + b;

   // In main.js
   import { add } from './math';
   ```

6. **Destructuring**: Destructuring allows you to extract values from arrays and objects into distinct variables easily.

   ```javascript
   const [x, y] = [1, 2];
   const { name, age } = { name: 'Alice', age: 30 };
   ```

7. **Default Parameters**: You can specify default values for function parameters, simplifying the handling of missing values.

   ```javascript
   function greet(name = 'Guest') {
       console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
   }
   ```

8. **Rest and Spread Operators**: These operators allow you to work with variable numbers of arguments and elements in arrays.

   ```javascript
   // Rest operator
   function sum(...numbers) {
       return numbers.reduce((total, num) => total + num, 0);
   }

   // Spread operator
   const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
   const arr2 = [4, ...arr1, 5];
   ```

These are just a few of the many features introduced in ES6. Subsequent versions of ECMAScript, such as ES7, ES8, and so on, have continued to enhance JavaScript with additional features and improvements.
